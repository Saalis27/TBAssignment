                        Travel is in my genes. My parents were great travelers and shared with me their joy of exploring new places.
                        Each of my journeys is preceded by studying the destination; its history, culture, and customs.
                         I want to capture the spirit of cultures that are threatened by extinction through the lense of my camera.
                         Travel takes me out of my comfort zone and inspires me to see, taste and try new things. It constantly challenges me, 
                         not only to adapt to and explore new surroundings, 
                         but also to engage with different people, 
                         to embrace adventures as they come and to share new and meaningful experiences with friends and loved ones. 
                         Whether you seek adrenaline and non-stop activity, 
                         or unapologetic siestas and ultimate relaxation, 
                         travel gives us the opportunity to explore with an open heart and an open mind.
